## Simple Calculator: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Simple Calculator app for Android!

This is a simple Android app developed by Chandra Agarwala of SanGiri Developers

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. No analytics software is present in the app either.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The app is not asking for any permission as its just a calculator app

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Chandra Agarwala.
